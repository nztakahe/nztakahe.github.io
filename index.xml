      <description>A friend of mine started doing Code Club at the local schools. With the recent christmas holidays I thought it would be a great Father and Son project.
Starting with the scratch you can find the projects
Basically it is drag and drop programming and you can create some games quickly - The code club example 3 with a score was a big success.
I have to say that it has been interesting.</description>

      <title>DNS Hosting Providers</title>

      <description>So just over a year ago I had the idea of registering a domain name. Working with DNS isn&amp;rsquo;t something new and I have done my bit as a sysadmin using windows, bind, AWS Route53, GCP Cloud DNS and Azure.
At the time I decided to use GoDaddy. I had used it for a job previously and the price was good. So 10 months later it tried to auto renew for twice the price as the initial purchase and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that idea.</description>

      <description>Static HTML Generators This is my first post using Hugo. And yes it is still rough around the edges.  ** Jekyll I had problems getting Jekyll to work that were most likely related to lack of understanding on my part more than issues with the product.
** HUGO So i started trying Hugo. Initially i tried using the govendor process which had an now reported error which is resolved by removing it from the installation documentation.</description>

      <description>From a corporate Microsoft background I had strong knowledge of Windows (Server desktop), Active Directory, Exchange, IIS, SQL Server etc. Along with the servers\services I picked up Server Hardware, SANs, Hypervisors (particularly VMWare) and Networking Wireless, Switches and Firewalls and did my fair share of Powershell and vbscript (You used what you could).
In more recent years I was lucky enough to challenge myself to learn\manage the LAMP - Linux (primarily Centos, Ubuntu), Apache 2.</description>

      <description>I thought it would be interesting to try learning a new programming langauge.
So i followed the instructions provided.
I originally published it to github pages as an experiment. This should now have been moved</description>
