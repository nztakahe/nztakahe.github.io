      <description>A friend of mine started doing Code Club at the local schools. With the recent christmas holidays I thought it would be a great Father and Son project.
Starting with the scratch you can find the projects
Basically it is drag and drop programming and you can create some games quickly - The code club example 3 with a score was a big success.
I have to say that it has been interesting.</description>

      <description>So just over a year ago I had the grand idea of registering a domain name. Working with DNS isn&amp;rsquo;t something new and I have done my bit as a sysadmin using windows, bind, AWS Route53, GCP Cloud DNS and some Azure.
At the time I decided to use GoDaddy. I had used it for a job previously and the price was good. So 10 months later it tried to auto renew for twice the price as the initial purchase but thankfully the credit card I had used had expired.</description>

So i followed the instructions provided.
I originally published it to github pages as an experiment. This should now have been moved</description>
